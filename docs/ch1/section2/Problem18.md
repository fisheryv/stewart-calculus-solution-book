Jade and her roommate Jari commute to work each morning, traveling west on I-10. One morning Jade left for work at 6:50 am, but Jari left 10 minutes later. Both drove at a constant speed. The graphs show the distance (in kilometers) each of them has traveled on I-10, $t$ minutes after 7:00 am.

1. Use the graph to decide which driver is traveling faster.

2. Find the speed (in km/h) at which each of them is driving.

3. Find linear functions $f$ and $t$ that model the distances traveled by Jade and Jari as functions of $t$ (in minutes).
