The table shows the number $N$ of species of reptiles and amphibians inhabiting Caribbean islands and the area $A$ of
the island in square kilometers.

1. Use a power function to model $N$ as a function of $A$.

2. The Caribbean island of Dominica has area $753 \ km^2$. How many species of reptiles and amphibians would you expect to find on Dominica?

</div>

|  Island      | $A$     | $N$     |
| ------------ | ------: | ------: |
| Saba         | 10      | 5       |
| Monserrat    | 103     | 9       | 
| Puerto Rico  | 8,959   | 40      |
| Jamaica      | 11,424  | 39      |
| Hispaniola   | 79,192  | 84      |
| Cuba         | 114,524 | 76      |

1. ![](_media/screenshots/26-08-2025%20Image023.jpg ':class=img-center')

    $$ 
    N = 2.34347 A^{0.306584} 
    $$

2. Substituting $A = 753$ to the formular above yields:

    $$
    \begin{align*}
    N &= 2.34347 \cdot 753^{0.306584} \\
    &= 17.8582 \\
    &\approx 18
    \end{align*}
    $$

    So I estimate that there are about $18$ species of reptiles and amphibians on the Caribbean island of Dominica.
