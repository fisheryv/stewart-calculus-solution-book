Suppose that a force or energy originates from a point source and spreads its influence equally in all directions,
such as the light from a lightbulb or the gravitational force of a planet. So at a distance $r$ from the source, the intensity $I$ of the force or energy is equal to the source strength $S$ divided by the surface area of a sphere of radius $r$. Show that $I$ satisfies the inverse square law $I = k/r^2$, where $k$ is a positive constant.
