Suppose that a force or energy originates from a point source and spreads its influence equally in all directions, such as the light from a lightbulb or the gravitational force of a planet. So at a distance $r$ from the source, the intensity $I$ of the force or energy is equal to the source strength $S$ divided by the surface area of a sphere of radius $r$. Show that $I$ satisfies the inverse square law $I = k/r^2$, where $k$ is a positive constant.

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

**Proof:**
The surface area of a sphere of radius $r$ is $A = 4\pi r^2$. According to the problem description, 

$$
I = \frac{S}{4\pi r^2} = \frac{\frac{S}{4\pi}}{r^2}
$$

Because $4\pi$ is a constant, given $S$, then $\frac{S}{4\pi}$ is a constant. Let $k = \frac{S}{4\pi}$, we get:

$$
I = \frac{k}{r^2}
$$

This shows that $I$ satisfies the inverse square law. $\blacksquare$
