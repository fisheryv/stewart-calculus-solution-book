The monthly cost of driving a car depends on the number of kilometers driven. Lynn found that in May it cost her $\$380$ to drive $770$ km and in June it cost her $\$460$ to drive $1290$ km.

1. Express the monthly cost $C$ as a function of the distance driven $d$, assuming that a linear relationship gives a suitable model.

2. Use part (1) to predict the cost of driving $2400$ km per month.

3. Draw the graph of the linear function. What does the slope represent?

4. What does the $C$-intercept represent?

5. Why does a linear function give a suitable model in this situation?
