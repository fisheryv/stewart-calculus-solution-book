<h4 class="alert-heading">Problem 35</h4>

It makes sense that the larger the area of a region, the larger the number of species that inhabit the region. Many ecologists have modeled the species-area relation with a power function. In particular, the number of species $S$ of bats living in caves in central Mexico has been related to the surface area A of the caves by the equation $S = 0.7A^{0.3}$.

1. The cave called *Misi√≥n Imposible* near Puebla, Mexico, has a surface area of $A = 60\ m^2$. How many species of bats would you expect to find in that cave?

2. If you discover that four species of bats live in a cave, estimate the area of the cave.

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

1. $S = 0.7A^{0.3} = 0.7 \cdot 60^{0.3} \approx 2.39$.

    Therefore, there may be $2$ species of bats in that cave.

2. Four species of bats means $S = 4$, substitute it into the equation $S = 0.7A^{0.3}$, we get:

    $$
    \begin{align*}
    4 &= 0.7A^{0.3} \\
    A^{0.3} &= \frac{40}{7} \\
    A &= \sqrt[3]{\Big(\frac{40}{7}\Big)^{10}} \\
    A &\approx 334 \ m^2
    \end{align*}
    $$

    Therefore, the area of the cave is about $334 \ m^2$.
