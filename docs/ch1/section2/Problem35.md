It makes sense that the larger the area of a region, the larger the number of species that inhabit the region. Many ecologists have modeled the species-area relation with a power function. In particular, the number of species $S$ of bats living in caves in central Mexico has been related to the surface area A of the caves by the equation $S = 0.7A^{0.3}$.

1. The cave called *Misi√≥n Imposible* near Puebla, Mexico, has a surface area of $A = 60 m^2$. How many species of bats would you expect to find in that cave?

2. If you discover that four species of bats live in a cave, estimate the area of the cave.
