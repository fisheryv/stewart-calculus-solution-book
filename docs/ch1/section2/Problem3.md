<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

Based on the even and odd nature of the functions, it can be concluded that $y = x^2$ and $y = x^8$ are even functions, while $y = x^5$ is an odd function. Therefore, $y = x^5$ corresponds to the graph $f$.

For $y = x^2$ and $y = x^8$, 

- when $|x| < 1$, $x^8 < x^2$; 

- when $|x| \ge 1$, $x^8 \ge x^2$. 

Thus, $y = x^2$ corresponds to $h$, and $y = x^8$ corresponds to $g$.
