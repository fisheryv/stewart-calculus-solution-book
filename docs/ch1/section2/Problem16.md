The manager of a weekend flea market knows from past experience that if he charges $x$ dollars for a rental space at
the market, then the number $y$ of spaces that will be rented is given by the equation $y = 200 - 4x$.

1. Sketch a graph of this linear function. (Remember that the rental charge per space and the number of spaces rented can't be negative quantities.)

2. What do the slope, the $y$-intercept, and the $x$-intercept of the graph represent?
