At the surface of the ocean, the water pressure is the same as the air pressure above the water, $1.05 \ kg/cm^2$
. Below the surface, the water pressure increases by $0.3 \ kg/cm^2$ for every $3$ m of descent.

1. Express the water pressure as a function of the depth below the ocean surface.

2. At what depth is the pressure $7 \ kg/cm^2$?
