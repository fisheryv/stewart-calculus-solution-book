At the surface of the ocean, the water pressure is the same as the air pressure above the water, $1.05 \ kg/cm^2$. Below the surface, the water pressure increases by $0.3 \ kg/cm^2$ for every $3$ m of descent.

1. Express the water pressure as a function of the depth below the ocean surface.

2. At what depth is the pressure $7 \ kg/cm^2$?

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

1. The water pressure function of the depth below the ocean surface can be expressed by a linear function. When depth is $0$, the pressure is $1.05 \ kg/cm^2$ï¼Œthat means the $y$-intercept is $1.05$. The water pressure increases by $0.3 \ kg/cm^2$ for every $3$ m tells us the slope is $\frac{0.3}{3}=0.1$. Therefore, the function is 
    $$p = 0.1 d + 1.05$$

2. Let $p = 7$, solve the linear equation $7 = 0.1d+1.05$, we get $d = 59.5$ m.
