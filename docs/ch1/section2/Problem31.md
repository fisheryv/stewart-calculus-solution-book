Anthropologists use a linear model that relates human femur (thighbone) length to height. The model allows an anthropologist to determine the height of an individual when only a partial skeleton (including the femur) is found. Here we find the model by analyzing the data on femur length and height for the eight males given in the table.

1. Make a scatter plot of the data.

2. Find and graph the regression line that models the data.

3. An anthropologist finds a human femur of length $53$ cm. How tall was the person?
