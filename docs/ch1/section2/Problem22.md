The resistance $R$ of a wire of fixed length is related to its diameter $x$ by an inverse square law, that is, by a function of the form $R(x) = kx^{-2}$.

1. A wire of fixed length and $0.005$ meters in diameter has a resistance of $140$ ohms. Find the value of $k$.

2. Find the resistance of a wire made of the same material and of the same length as the wire in part (1) but with a diameter of $0.008$ meters.

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

1. Substitute $x=0.005, R(x) = 140$ into $R(x) = kx^{-2}$ yields $140 = k \cdot (0.005)^{-2}$. 

    $$k = 0.0035$$

2. The same material and the same length means the same $k$. Substitute $x=0.008$ into $R(x) = 0.0035x^{-2}$, we get

    $$R(x) = 0.0035 \cdot (0.008)^{-2} = 54.6875$$
