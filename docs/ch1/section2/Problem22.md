The resistance $R$ of a wire of fixed length is related to its diameter $x$ by an inverse square law, that is, by a function of the form $R(x) = kx^{-2}$.

1. A wire of fixed length and $0.005$ meters in diameter has a resistance of $140$ ohms. Find the value of $k$.

2. Find the resistance of a wire made of the same material and of the same length as the wire in part (1) but with a
diameter of $0.008$ meters.
