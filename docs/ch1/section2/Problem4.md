Match each equation with its graph. Explain your choices. (Don't use a computer or graphing calculator.)

1. $y = 3x$

2. $y = 3^x$

3. $y = x^3$

4. $y = \sqrt[3]{x}$

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

1. $y = 3x$ is a **linear function**, its graph is a line, so it corresponds to the graph $G$.

2. $y = 3^x$ is an **exponential function**, so it corresponds to the graph $f$.

3. $y = x^3$ is a **power function** and it's also an odd function, so it corresponds to the graph $F$.

4. $y = \sqrt[3]{x}$ is a **root function** and it's also an **odd function**, so it corresponds to the graph $g$.
