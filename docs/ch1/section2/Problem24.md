The pressure $P$ of a sample of oxygen gas that is compressed at a constant temperature is related to the volume $V$ of gas by a reciprocal function of the form $P = k/V$.

1. A sample of oxygen gas that occupies $0.671 m^3$ exerts a pressure of $39$ kPa at a temperature of $293$ K (absolute temperature measured on the Kelvin scale). Find the value of $k$ in the given model.

2. If the sample expands to a volume of $0.916 \ m^3$, find the new pressure.

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

1. Substitute $V=0.671, P = 39$ into $P = k/V$ yields $39 = k / 0.671$. 

    $$k = 26.169$

2. Substitute $V=0.916$ into $P = 26.169 / V$, we get

    $$P = 26.169 / 0.916 \approx 28.57$$
