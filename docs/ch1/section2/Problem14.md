<h4 class="alert-heading">Problem 14</h4>

Recent studies indicate that the average surface temperature of the earth has been rising steadily. Some scientists have modeled the temperature by the linear function $T = 0.02t + 8.50$, where $T$ is temperature in $\degree C$ and $t$ represents years since 1900.

1. What do the slope and $T$-intercept represent?

2. Use the equation to predict the earth's average surface temperature in 2100.

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

1. The slope is $0.02$ and the $T$-intercept $8.50$.

    The slope indicates the increase in temperature for each additional year. The $T$-intercept represents the average surface temperature of the earth in 1900.

2. $t = 2100 - 1900 = 200$, so $T = 0.02t + 8.50 = 0.02 \cdot 200 + 8.50 = 12.50$.

    Therefore, according to the model, the earth's average surface temperature in 2100 is $12.50 \degree C$.
