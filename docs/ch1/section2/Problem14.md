Recent studies indicate that the average surface temperature of the earth has been rising steadily. Some scientists have modeled the temperature by the linear function $T = 0.02t + 8.50$, where $T$ is temperature in $\degree C$ and $t$ represents years since 1900.

1. What do the slope and $T$-intercept represent?

2. Use the equation to predict the earthâ€™s average surface temperature in 2100.
