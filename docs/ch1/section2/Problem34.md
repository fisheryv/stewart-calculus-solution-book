The table shows the mean (average) distances d of the planets from the sun (taking the unit of measurement to be the distance from the earth to the sun) and their periods T (time of revolution in years).

1. Fit a power model to the data.

2. Keplerâ€™s Third Law of Planetary Motion states that "The square of the period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of its mean distance from the sun." Does your model corroborate Kepler's Third Law?
