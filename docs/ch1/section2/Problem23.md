<h4 class="alert-heading">Problem 23</h4>

The illumination of an object by a light source is related to the distance from the source by an inverse square law. Suppose that after dark you are sitting in a room with just one lamp, trying to read a book. The light is too dim, so you move your chair halfway to the lamp. How much brighter is the light?

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

According to the problem description, we can establish a functional relationship between illumination and distance. Let the illumination be $I$ and the distance be $r$. Given that they satisfy an inverse square relationship, we can express $I$ as a function of $r$:

$$ I = \frac{a}{r^2} $$

where $a$ is a positive constant.

When the distance is halved, that is, when $r$ becomes $\frac{r}{2}$, the illumination becomes

$$
I' = \frac{a}{(\frac{r}{2})^2} = \frac{a}{\frac{r^2}{4}} = \frac{4a}{r^2} = 4I
$$

Thus, when the distance is reduced by half, the illumination becomes $4$ times the original.
