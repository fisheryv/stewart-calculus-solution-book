<h4 class="alert-heading">Problem 25</h4>

The power output of a wind turbine depends on many factors. It can be shown using physical principles that the power $P$ generated by a wind turbine is modeled by
$$P = kAv^3$$
where $v$ is the wind speed, A is the area swept out by the blades, and $k$ is a constant that depends on air density, efficiency of the turbine, and the design of the wind turbine blades. 

1. If only wind speed is doubled, by what factor is the power output increased?

2. If only the length of the blades is doubled, by what factor is the power output increased?

3. For a particular wind turbine, the length of the blades is $30$ m and $k = 0.214 \  kg/m^3$. Find the power output (in watts, $W = m^2 \cdot kg/s^3$) when the wind speed is $10$ m/s, $15$ m/s, and $25$ m/s.

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

1. According to the model $P = kAv^3$, there is a cubic relationship between power $P$ and wind speed $v$. So, If wind speed is doubled, the power generated increased $2^3=8$ times.

2. According to the model $P = kAv^3$, there is a linear relationship between power $P$ and the area swept out by the blades $A$. The area swept out by the blades is a sector, which is $A = \frac{\theta r^2}{2}$. So, If length of the blades is doubled, the area swept out by the blades is increased $4$ times, then the power generated is increased $4$ times.

3. If the length of the blades is $30$ m, then the the area swept out by the blades $A = \pi r^2 = 900 \pi$.
   
    - When the wind speed is $10$ m/s, $P = kAv^3 = 0.214 \cdot 900 \pi \cdot 10^3 = 192,600 \pi$
    - When the wind speed is $15$ m/s, $P = kAv^3 = 0.214 \cdot 900 \pi \cdot 15^3 = 650,025 \pi$
    - When the wind speed is $25$ m/s, $P = kAv^3 = 0.214 \cdot 900 \pi \cdot 25^3 = 3,009,375 \pi$
