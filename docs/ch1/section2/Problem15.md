If the recommended adult dosage for a drug is $D$ (in mg), then to determine the appropriate dosage $c$ for a child of 
age $a$, pharmacists use the equation $c = 0.0417D(a + 1)$. Suppose the dosage for an adult is $200$ mg.

1. Find the slope of the graph of $c$. What does it represent?

2. What is the dosage for a newborn?

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

1. Suppose the dosage for an adult is $200$ mg, that is $D=200$. So the slope of the graph of $c$ is $0.0417D = 0.0417 \cdot 200 = 8.34 \text{\ mg}$, which indicates the amount of increase in dosage for each one-year increase in the child's age.

2. The age of newborns is $0$, i.e., $a=0$, therefore the dosage for a newborn is:

    $$
    \begin{align*}
    c &= 0.0417D(a + 1) \\
    &= 0.0417 \cdot 200 \cdot (0 + 1) \\
    &= 8.34 \text{\ mg}
    \end{align*}
    $$
