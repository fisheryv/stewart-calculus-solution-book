1. If $g(x) = 2x + 1$ and $h(x) = 4x^2 + 4x + 7$, find a function $f$ such that $f \circ g = h$. (Think about what operations you would have to perform on the formula for $g$ to end up with the formula for $h$.)

2. If $f(x) = 3x + 5$ and $h(x) = 3x^2 + 3x + 2$, find a function $g$ such that $f \circ g = h$.
