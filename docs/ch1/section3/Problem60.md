A spherical balloon is being inflated and the radius of the balloon is increasing at a rate of $2$ cm/s.

1. Express the radius $r$ of the balloon as a function of the time $t$ (in seconds).

2. If $V$ is the volume of the balloon as a function of the radius, find $V \circ r$ and interpret it.

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

1. $r = 2 t$

2. The volume of sphere is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, so $A \circ r = \frac{4}{3}\pi (2t)^3 = \frac{32}{3}\pi t^3$, which means the volume of sphere at time $t$.
