A ship is moving at a speed of $30$ km/h parallel to a straight shoreline. The ship is $6$ km from shore and it passes a lighthouse at noon.

1. Express the distance $s$ between the lighthouse and the ship as a function of $d$, the distance the ship has traveled since noon; that is, find $f$ so that $s = f(d)$.

2. Express $d$ as a function of $t$, the time elapsed since noon; that is, find $g$ so that $d = g(t)$.

3. Find $f \circ t$. What does this function represent?
