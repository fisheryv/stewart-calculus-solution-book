Let $f(x)$ be a function with domain $\mathbb{R}$. 

1. Show that $E(x) = f(x) + f(-x)$ is an even function.

2. Show that $O(x) = f(x) - f(-x)$ is an odd function.

3. Prove that every function $f(x)$ can be written as a sum of an even function and an odd function.

4. Express the function $f(x) = 2^x + (x - 3)^2$ as a sum of an even function and an odd function.
