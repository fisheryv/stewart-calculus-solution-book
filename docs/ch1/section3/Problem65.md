Let $f$ and $g$ be linear functions with equations $f(x) = m_1 x + b_1$ and $g(x) = m_2 x + b_2$. Is $f \circ g$ also a linear function? If so, what is the slope of its graph?

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

$$
\begin{aligned}
(f \circ g)(x) &= f(g(x)) \\
&= m_1 (m_2 x + b_2) + b_1 \\
&= m_1m_2 x + m_1b_2 + b_1 \\
&= \underbrace{(m_1m_2)}_{m} x + \underbrace{(m_1b_2 + b_1)}_{b} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, $f \circ g$ is also a linear function, and the slope of its graph is $m_1m_2$.
