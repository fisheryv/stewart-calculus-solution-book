<h4 class="alert-heading">Problem 2</h4>

Explain how each graph is obtained from the graph of $y = f(x)$.

1. $y = f(x) + 8$

2. $y = f(x + 8)$

3. $y = 8f(x)$

4. $y = f(8x)$

5. $y = -f(x) - 1$

6. $y = 8f(\frac{1}{8} x)$

</div>

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

1. Shift $8$ units upward.

2. Shift $8$ units to the left.

3. Stretch vertically by a factor of $8$.

4. Shrink horizontally by a factor of $8$.

5. Reflect about the $x$-axis and then shift $1$ unit downward.

6. Stretch horizontally and vertically by a factor of $8$.
