**The Heaviside Function**

The *Heaviside function $H$* is defined by

$$
\begin{cases}
0 & if t<0\\
1 & if t \ge 0
\end{cases}
$$

It is used in the study of electric circuits to represent the sudden surge of electric current, or voltage, when a switch is instantaneously turned on.

1. Sketch the graph of the Heaviside function.

2. Sketch the graph of the voltage $V(t)$ in a circuit if the switch is turned on at time $t = 0$ and $120$ volts are applied instantaneously to the circuit. Write a formula for $V(t)$ in terms of $H(t)$.

3. Sketch the graph of the voltage $V(t)$ in a circuit if the switch is turned on at time $t = 5$ seconds and $240$ volts are applied instantaneously to the circuit. Write a formula for $V(t)$ in terms of $H(t)$. (Note that starting at $t = 5$ corresponds to a translation.)
