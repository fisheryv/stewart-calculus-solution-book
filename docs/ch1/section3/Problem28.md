A variable star is one whose brightness alternately increases and decreases. For the most visible variable star, Delta Cephei, the time between periods of maximum brightness is 5.4 days, the average brightness (or magnitude) of the star is $4.0$, and its brightness varies by $\pm 0.35$ magnitude. Find a function that models the brightness of Delta Cephei as a function of time.

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

Because the brightness of Delta Cephei is periodic, we can get its brightness function by applying appropriate transformations to the function $\sin x$.

First, since the maximum brightness period is 5.4 days, we scale the function period from $2\pi$ to $5.4$

$$ B(t) = \sin \Big(\frac{2\pi t}{5.4} \Big) $$

Then, since the brightness varies by $\pm 0.35$ magnitude, we reduce the amplitude from $1$ to $0.35$

$$ B(t) = 0.35 \sin \Big(\frac{2\pi t}{5.4} \Big)$$

Finally, since the average brightness is $4.0$, we shift the graph of the function $4$ units upward.

$$ B(t) = 0.35 \sin \Big(\frac{2\pi t}{5.4} \Big) + 4.0$$
