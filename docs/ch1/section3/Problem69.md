Suppose $g$ is an even function and let $h = f \circ g$. Is $h$ always an even function?

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

Since $g$ is an even function, we know that $g(-x) = g(x)$.

$h(x) = (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$

$h(-x) = (f \circ g)(-x) = f(g(-x)) = f(g(x)) = h(x)$

Therefore, if $g$ is an even function, $h = f \circ g$ is always an even function.
