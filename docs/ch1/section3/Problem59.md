A stone is dropped into a lake, creating a circular ripple that travels outward at a speed of $60$ cm/s.

1. Express the radius $r$ of this circle as a function of the time $t$ (in seconds).

2. If $A$ is the area of this circle as a function of the radius, find $A \circ r$ and interpret it.

</div>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

1. $r = 60 t$

2. The area of circle is $A = \pi r^2$, so $A \circ r = \pi (60t)^2 = 3600 \pi t^2$, which means the rippled area at time $t$.
