In a normal respiratory cycle the volume of air that moves into and out of the lungs is about $500$ mL. The reserve and residue volumes of air that remain in the lungs occupy about $2000$ mL and a single respiratory cycle for an average human takes about $4$ seconds. Find a model for the total volume of air $V(t)$ in the lungs as a function of time.
