Suppose $g$ is an odd function and let $h = f \circ g$. Is $h$ always an odd function? What if $f$ is odd? What if $f$ is even?

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

Since $g$ is an odd function, we know that $g(-x) = -g(x)$.

$h(x) = (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$

$h(-x) = (f \circ g)(-x) = f(g(-x)) = f(-g(x))$

Therefore, we cannot determine the parity of function $h = f \circ g$. The parity of function $f$ is required.

- If $f$ is odd, $h(-x) = (f \circ g)(-x) = f(g(-x)) = f(-g(x)) = -f(g(x)) = -h(x)$, $h$ is an odd function.

- If $f$ is even, $h(-x) = (f \circ g)(-x) = f(g(-x)) = f(-g(x)) = f(g(x)) = h(x)$, $h$ is an even
 function.
