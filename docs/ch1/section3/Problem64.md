**The Ramp Function**

The Heaviside function defined in [Exercise 63](/docs/ch1/section3/Problem63.md) can also be used to define the *ramp function* $y = ctH(t)$, which represents a gradual increase in voltage or current in a circuit.

1. Sketch the graph of the ramp function $y = tH(t)$.

2. Sketch the graph of the voltage $V(t)$ in a circuit if the switch is turned on at time $t = 0$ and the voltage is gradually increased to $120$ volts over a 60-second time interval. Write a formula for $V(t)$ in terms of $H(t)$ for $t < 60$.

3. Sketch the graph of the voltage $V(t)$ in a circuit if the switch is turned on at time $t = 7$ seconds and the voltage is gradually increased to $100$ volts over a period of $25$ seconds. Write a formula for $V(t)$ in terms of $H(t)$ for $t < 32$.
