Some of the highest tides in the world occur in the Bay of Fundy on the Atlantic Coast of Canada. At Hopewell Cape the water depth at low tide is about $2.0$ m and at high tide it is about 12.0 m. The natural period of oscillation is about 12 hours and on a particular day, high tide occurred at 6:45 am. Find a function involving the cosine function that models the water depth $D(t)$ (in meters) as a function of time $t$ (in hours after midnight) on that day.
