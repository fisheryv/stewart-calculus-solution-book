1. Suppose $f$ is a one-to-one function with domain $A$ and range $B$. How is the inverse function $f^{-1}$ defined? What is the domain of $f^{-1}$? What is the range of $f^{-1}$?

2. If you are given a formula for $f$, how do you find a formula for $f^{-1}$?

3. If you are given the graph of $f$, how do you find the graph of $f^{-1}$?
