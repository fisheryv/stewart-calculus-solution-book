<h4 class="alert-heading">Problem 68</h4>

The National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory maintains the world's largest laser facility. The lasers, which are used to start a nuclear fusion reaction, are powered by a capacitor bank that stores a total of about $400$ megajoules of energy. When the lasers are fired the capacitors discharge completely and then immediately begin recharging. The charge $Q$ of the capacitors t seconds after the discharge is given by 
$$ Q(t) = Q_0(1 - e^{-t/a}) $$
(The maximum charge capacity is $Q_0$ and t is measured in seconds.)

1. Find a formula for the inverse of this function and explain its meaning.

2. How long does it take to recharge the capacitors to $90\%$ of capacity if $a = 50$?
