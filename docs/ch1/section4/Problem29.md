A bacteria culture starts with $500$ bacteria and doubles in size every half hour.

1. How many bacteria are there after $3$ hours?

2. How many bacteria are there after $t$ hours?

3. How many bacteria are there after $40$ minutes?

4. ðŸ“ˆ Graph the population function and estimate the time for the population to reach $100,000$.

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

$$
f(t) = 500 \cdot 2^{t/0.5} = 500 \cdot 2^{2t}
$$

1. When $t=3$, $f(3) = 500 \cdot 2^6 = 32000$.

2. 

3. $40$ minutes are $\frac{2}{3}$ hour, so 
    
    $$
    \f(\frac{2}{3}) = 500 \cdot 2^{2 \cdot \frac{2}{3}} = 500 \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{3}}  \approx 1260
    $$

4. The graph of the function in question (2) is shown below.

    It's about $3.822$ hours for the population to reach $100,000$
