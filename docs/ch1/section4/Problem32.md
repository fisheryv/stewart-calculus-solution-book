After alcohol is fully absorbed into the body, it is metabolized. Suppose that after consuming several alcoholic drinks earlier in the evening, your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at midnight is $0.14$ g/dL. After $1.5$ hours your BAC is half this amount.

1. Find an exponential model for your BAC $t$ hours after midnight.

2. ðŸ“ˆ Graph your BAC and use the graph to determine when your BAC reaches the legal limit of $0.08$ g/dL.

1. The initial value is $0.14$, and it halves every $1.5$ hours. This process can be modeled as follows:

    $$f(t) = 0.14 \cdot \Big(\frac{1}{2}\Big)^{\frac{t}{1.5}}$$

2. The graph of the function above is shown below.

    Accroding to the graph above, the BAC goes down to the legal limit of $0.08$ g/dL in about $1.2$ hours.
