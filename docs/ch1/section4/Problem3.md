Use the Laws of Exponents to rewrite and simplify each expression.

1. Write an equation that defines the exponential function with base $b > 0$.

2. What is the domain of this function?

3. If $b \ne 1$, what is the range of this function?

4. Sketch the general shape of the graph of the exponential function for each of the following cases.
    - $b > 1$
    - $b = 1$
    - $0 < b < 1$
