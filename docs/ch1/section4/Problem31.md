In Example 4, the patient's viral load $V$ was $76.0$ RNA copies per mL after one day of treatment. Use the graph of $V$ in Figure 11 to estimate the additional time required for the viral load to decrease to half that amount.

Half of $76.0$ is $38.0$. According to Figure 11, RNA copies $38$ corresponds $t \approx 4.5$, as shown in the figure below:

According to the model in Example 4

$$
V = 96.39785 \cdot (0.818656)^t
$$

when $V = 38.0$, the solution is $t \approx 4.65$. This is basically consistent with our estimation on the graph.

The question asks for the additional time relative to $t=1$, so the answer is $4.5-1 = 3.5$.
