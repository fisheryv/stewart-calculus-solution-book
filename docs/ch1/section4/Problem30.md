A gray squirrel population was introduced in a certain region $18$ years ago. Biologists observe that the population doubles every six years, and now the population is $600$.

1. What was the initial squirrel population?

2. What is the expected squirrel population $t$ years after introduction?

3. Estimate the expected squirrel population $10$ years from now.

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

1. Let $p$ be the initial squirrel population. According to the description: the population doubles every six years, and the population is $600$ after $18$ years, we get the following equition:

    $$
    \begin{align*}
    p \cdot 2^{\frac{18}{6}} &= 600 \\
    p \cdot 2^{3} &= 600 \\ 
    8p &= 600 \\
    p &= 75
    \end{align*}
    $$

    Therefore, the initial squirrel population is $75$.

2. $\displaystyle f(t) = 75 \cdot 2^{\frac{t}{6}}$

3. $10$ years from now is $28$ years after introduction. Let $t=28$ and substitute it into the equation above, we can obtain

    $$
    f(28) = 75 \cdot 2^{\frac{28}{6}} \approx 1905
    $$

    Therefore, the expected squirrel population $10$ years from now is $1905$.
