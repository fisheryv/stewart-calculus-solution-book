Compare the functions $f(x) = x^5$ and $g(x) = 5^x$ by graphing both functions in several viewing rectangles. Find all points of intersection of the graphs correct to one decimal place. Which function grows more rapidly when $x$ is large?

There are two intersection points, as shown in the figure below.

The figure above shows that when $x > 5$, $g(x)$ grows more rapidly than $f(x)$.
