Starting with the graph of $y = e^x$, find the equation of the graph that results from

1. reflecting about the line $y = 4$.

2. reflecting about the line $x = 2$.

</div>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

1. Reflecting about the line $y = 4$ can be decomposed into reflecting about the $x$-axis and shifting $8$ unit upward. So, the equation after reflecting is $y = -e^x + 8$.

2. Reflecting about the line $x = 2$ can be decomposed into reflecting about the $y$-axis and shifting $4$ unit to the right. So, the equation after reflecting is $y = e^{-x+4}$.

</div>
