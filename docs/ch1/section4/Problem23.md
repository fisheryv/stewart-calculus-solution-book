Suppose the graphs of $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = 2^x$ are drawn on a coordinate grid where the unit of measurement is $3$ centimeters. Show that at a distance $1$ m to the right of the origin, the height of the graph of $f$ is $15$ m but the height of the graph of $g$ is about $419$ km.

!> This question might have an issue - at a distance $1$ m to the right of the origin, the height of the graph of both $f$ and g(x) cannot be $15$ m and $419$ km. If I have misunderstood the problem, please feel free to correct me and provide the right solution.

The graphs are drawn on a coordinate grid where $1$ unit corresponds to $3$ cm in both the horizontal and vertical directions.

We are interested in the point that is $1$ m to the right of the origin, we find $x = \frac{100}{3}$ units. 

- For function $f(x) = x^2$, at $x = \frac{100}{3}$, the height in units is:

    $$
    f\left(\frac{100}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{100}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{10000}{9}
    $$

    Convert to meters:

    $$
    \frac{10000}{9} \text{\ (unit)} = \frac{10000}{9} \times 3 = \frac{10000}{3} \text{\ (cm)} = \frac{10000}{3} \times \frac{1}{100} = \frac{100}{3} \text{\ (m)} \approx 33 \text{\ (m)}
    $$

- For function $g(x) = 2^x$, at $x = \frac{100}{3}$, the height in units is:

    $$
    g\left(\frac{100}{3}\right) = 2^{\frac{100}{3}} \approx 10822639410
    $$

    Convert to kilometers:

    $$
    10822639410 \text{\ (unit)} = 10822639410 \times 3 = 32467918230 \text{\ (cm)} = \frac{32467918230}{1000000} \approx 324679 \text{\ (km)}
    $$
