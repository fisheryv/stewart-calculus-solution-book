The population of a certain species in a limited environment with initial population $100$ and carrying capacity $1000$ is

$$ P(t)  = \frac{100,000}{100+900e^{-t}} $$

where $t$ is measured in years.

1. ðŸ“ˆ Graph this function and estimate how long it takes for the population to reach $900$.

2. Find the inverse of this function and explain its meaning.

3. Use the inverse function to find the time required for the population to reach $900$. Compare with the result of part (1).
