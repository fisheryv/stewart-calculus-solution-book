Assuming the total economic volume of coffee consumption is fixed, i.e., $F = m \cdot p$, where $p$ represents the unit price and $m$ represents the sales volume. Then, the relationship between coffee sales volume and price follows an inverse proportional function, i.e., $m = \frac{F}{p}$. Therefore, the graph of this function is as follows:
