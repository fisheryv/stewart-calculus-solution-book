<h4 class="alert-heading">Problem 20</h4>

Trees grow faster and form wider rings in warm years and grow more slowly and form narrower rings in cooler years. The figure shows ring widths of a Siberian pine from $1500$ to $2000$.

1. What is the range of the ring width function?

2. What does the graph tend to say about the temperature of the earth? Does the graph reflect the volcanic eruptions of the mid-19th century?

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

1. The lowest point of the ring width function's graph is close to $0$ (but not exactly $0$);The highest point of the ring width function's graph is about $1.6$. So the range of the ring width function is $(0, 1.6)$.

2. Based on the tree-ring width data from Mongolia (1500-2000 AD), the graph reveals the following about Earth's temperature and volcanic impacts:

    - From 1550 to 1700, the width of tree rings gradually decreases. This indicates that the temperature  decreased consistently during this period. Especially in the mid to late 17th century, temperature dropped sharply.
    - From 1700 to 1800, the width of tree rings began to increase, especially in the mid-18th century, the width of tree rings sharply increased, reflecting a rapid rise in temperature. At the end of the 18th century, the width of tree rings sharply decreased, reflecting a sharp drop in temperature. The sharp peaks on the graph indicates that there may be abnormal events occurring here.
    - From 1800 to 1900, the width of tree rings showed a decreasing trend overall, reflecting a slow decline in temperatures.
    - After 1900, the width of tree rings continued to rise rapidly, reflecting a sustained increase in temperature.

    The graph of tree-ring widths from the mid-19th century do not show significant differences. Many factors affect tree growth, and the impact of volcanic eruptions on climate, which indirectly affects tree growth, is just one of many factors. Therefore, I think the graph do not reflect the influence of volcanic eruptions.

> In the whole 19th century, there are several large volcanic eruptions, most notably Tambora (1815) and Krakatoa (1883). These eruptions injected massive amounts of aerosols into the stratosphere, reflecting sunlight and causing significant global cooling for 1-3 years after each event.
