Trees grow faster and form wider rings in warm years and grow more slowly and form narrower rings in cooler years. The figure shows ring widths of a Siberian pine from $1500$ to $2000$.

1. What is the range of the ring width function?
2. What does the graph tend to say about the temperature of the earth? Does the graph reflect the volcanic eruptions of the mid-19th century?
