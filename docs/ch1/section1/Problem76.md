1. If the point $(5, 3)$ is on the graph of an even function, what other point must also be on the graph?

2. If the point $(5, 3)$ is on the graph of an odd function, what other point must also be on the graph?

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

1. Even functions are symmetric about the y-axis, so if the point $(5, 3)$ is on the graph of an even function, then we know point $(-5, 3)$ must also be on the graph.

2. Odd functions are symmetric about the origin, so if the point $(5, 3)$ is on the graph of an odd function, then we know point $(-5, -3)$ must also be on the graph.
