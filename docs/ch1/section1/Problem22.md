You place a frozen pie in an oven and bake it for an hour. Then you take it out and let it cool. Describe how the temperature of the pie changes as time passes. Then sketch a rough graph of the temperature of the pie as a function of time.

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

Microwave ovens emit microwaves to rapidly vibrate water molecules in food, generating heat and thereby heating the food. Therefore, the maximum temperature for heating food in a microwave is the boiling point of water, which is $100 \degree C$. When a frozen pie is heated in the microwave, its temperature quickly rises to $100 \degree C$ and then remains at that level. After the pie is taken out of the microwave, its temperature gradually decreases to room temperature.

Therefore, the graph of the pie temperature as a function of time is as follows:
