7. $3x - 5y = 7$

8. $3x^2 - 2y = 5$

9. $x^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 5$

10. $2xy + 5y^2 = 4$

11. $(y + 3)^3 + 1 = 2x$ 

12. $2x - |y| = 0$

    | 150             | 8             |

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

7. **Yes**. This is a linear function.

    Expressing $y$ in terms of $x$ yields:
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        3x - 5y &= 7 \\
        5y &= 3x-7\\
        y &= \frac{3}{5}x-\frac{7}{5}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    For each value of $x$, there is exactly only one value of $y$. Therefore, the equation defines $y$ as a function of $x$.

8. **Yes**. This is a quadratic function.

    Expressing $y$ in terms of $x$ yields:
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        3x^2 - 2y &= 5 \\
        2y &= 3x^2-5\\
        y &= \frac{3}{2}x^2-\frac{5}{2}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    For each value of $x$, there is exactly only one value of $y$. Therefore, the equation defines $y$ as a function of $x$.

9. **No**. This equation **Does NOT** defines $y$ as a function of $x$.

    Expressing $y$ in terms of $x$ yields:
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        x^2 + (y - 3)^2 &= 5 \\
        (y - 3)^2 &= 5 - x^2 \\
        y - 3 &= \pm \sqrt{5-x^2} \\
        y &= 3 \pm \sqrt{5-x^2}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    For each value of $x$, there are two values of $y$. Graphically, this is the equation of a circle. For any given $x$, there exist two corresponding $y$ values that satisfy the equation. Therefore, it does not satisfy the definition of a function.

10. **No**. This equation **Does NOT** defines $y$ as a function of $x$.

    Treating $2x$ as the coefficient, we can regard this equation as a quadratic equation in $y$. Using the quadratic formula, we obtain:
    $$
    y = \frac{-x \pm \sqrt{x^2+20}}{5}
    $$
    For each value of $x$, there are two values of $y$. Therefore, it does not satisfy the definition of a function.

11. **Yes**. This is a cubic function.

    Expressing $y$ in terms of $x$ yields:
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        (y + 3)^3 + 1 &= 2x \\
        (y + 3)^3 &= 2x - 1 \\
        y + 3 &= \sqrt[3]{2x-1} \\
        y &= \sqrt[3]{2x-1} - 3
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    For each value of $x$, there is exactly only one value of $y$. Therefore, the equation defines $y$ as a function of $x$.

12. **No**. This equation **Does NOT** defines $y$ as a function of $x$.

    Expressing $y$ in terms of $x$ yields:
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        2x - |y| &= 0 \\
        |y| &= 2x \\
        y &= \pm 2x
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    For each value of $x$, there are two values of $y$. Therefore, it does not satisfy the definition of a function.

13. **No**. This table **Does NOT** defines $y$ as a function of $x$.

    Because $x=150$ corresponds to two values of $y$ ($y=7$ and $y=8$). Therefore, it does not satisfy the definition of a function.

14. **Yes**. This table defines $y$ as a function of $x$.

    Because for each value of $x$, there is exactly only one value of $y$.

> For some simple equations, we can directly substitute specific values of $x$ to check the value of $y$. If the value of $y$ is not unique, then we find a counterexample to assert that it is not a function.
