Researchers measured the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of eight adult male subjects after rapid consumption of $30$ mL of ethanol (corresponding to two standard alcoholic drinks). The table shows the data they obtained by averaging the BAC (in g/dL) of the eight men.

1. Use the readings to sketch a graph of the BAC as a function of $t$.

2. Use your graph to describe how the effect of alcohol varies with time.
