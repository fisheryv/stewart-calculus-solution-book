Figure 1 was recorded by an instrument operated by the California Department of Mines and Geology at 
the University Hospital of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Use it to estimate the range of the vertical ground acceleration function at USC during the Northridge earthquake.

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

The y-axis represents the vertical ground acceleration. Therefore, by drawing perpendicular lines from the highest and lowest points of the function graph to the y-axis, the points of intersection with the y-axis are the upper and lower limits of the range. So, the answer is

$[-90, 130]$
