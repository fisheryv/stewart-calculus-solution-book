An airplane takes off from an airport and lands an hour later at another airport, $650$ kilometers away. If $t$ represents the time in minutes since the plane has left the terminal building, let $x(t)$ be the horizontal distance traveled and $y(t)$ be the altitude of the plane.

1. Sketch a possible graph of $x(t)$.

2. Sketch a possible graph of $y(t)$.

3. Sketch a possible graph of the ground speed.

4. Sketch a possible graph of the vertical velocity.
