An airplane takes off from an airport and lands an hour later at another airport, $650$ kilometers away. If $t$ represents the time in minutes since the plane has left the terminal building, let $x(t)$ be the horizontal distance traveled and $y(t)$ be the altitude of the plane.

1. Sketch a possible graph of $x(t)$.

2. Sketch a possible graph of $y(t)$.

3. Sketch a possible graph of the ground speed.

4. Sketch a possible graph of the vertical velocity.

1. During takeoff, an airplane undergoes an acceleration process starting from zero, and during landing, it goes through a deceleration process until it comes to a complete stop. The mid-flight phase is essentially uniform motion. Therefore, the graph is as follows:

2. During takeoff, an airplane undergoes a uniform climb, and during landing, it undergoes a uniform descent. The mid-flight phase maintains a fixed altitude. Therefore, the graph is as follows:

3. As described in question 1, the airplane's speed relative to the ground first increases uniformly, then remains constant at a fixed speed during cruise, and finally decreases uniformly until it comes to a stop during descent. Therefore, the graph is as follows:

4. As described in question 2, the vertical velocity of the airplane first increases uniformly upward, then remains stationary, and during descent, it decreases uniformly downward until landing. In physics, velocity is a vector quantity, represented by positive and negative signs to indicate direction. Therefore, the graph is as follows:
