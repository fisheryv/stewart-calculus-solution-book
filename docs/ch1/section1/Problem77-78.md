**Problem 77**

- $f$ is an odd function. Because for any $x$ in domain, $f(-x) = -f(x)$. Intuitively, the graph of the function $f$ is symmetric about the origin.

- $g$ is an even function. Because for any $x$ in domain, $f(-x) = f(x)$. Intuitively, the graph of the function $g$ is symmetric about the y-axis.

--------

**Problem 78**

- $f$ is nether an odd function nor an even function. Because it is neither symmetric about the origin nor symmetric about the y-axis.

- $g$ is an even function. Because for any $x$ in domain, $f(x) = f(-x)$. Intuitively, the graph of the function $g$ is symmetric about the y-axis.
