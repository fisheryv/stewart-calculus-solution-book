If 
$$
f(x) = \frac{x^2-x}{x-1} \quad\text{and}\quad g(x)=x
$$
is it true that $f = g$?

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

No, $f \ne g$.

Because they have different domains. The domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{R} - \{1\}$, whereas the domain of $g$ is $\mathbb{R}$.

By the way, function $g$ is also known as the **identity function**.
