The graph shows the power consumption for a day in September in San Francisco. ($P$ is measured in megawatts; $t$ is measured in hours starting at midnight.)

1. What was the power consumption at 6 am? At 6 pm?
2. When was the power consumption the lowest? When was it the highest? Do these times seem reasonable?

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

1. The power consumption at 6 am is about $500$ megawatts; And the power consumption at 6 pm is about $720$ megawatts.

2. From the graph, the lowest point of the function graph appears at **4 am** and the highest point appears at **12 pm**.  I think this is reasonable, as most people are already asleep by 4 am, so electricity consumption is naturally very low. On the other hand, at 12 pm, various activities are taking place, and lunchtime further increases electricity usage.
