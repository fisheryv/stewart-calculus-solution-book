The graph shows the power consumption for a day in September in San Francisco. ($P$ is measured in megawatts; $t$ is measured in hours starting at midnight.)

1. What was the power consumption at 6 am? At 6 pm?
2. When was the power consumption the lowest? When was it the highest? Do these times seem reasonable?
