If $f$ and $g$ are both even functions, is the product $fg$ even? If $f$ and $g$ are both odd functions, is $fg$ odd? What if $f$ is even and $g$ is odd? Justify your answers.

- When $f$ and $g$ are both even functions, $f(-x) = f(x), g(-x) = g(x)$, such that

    $$
    (fg)(-x) = f(-x) \cdot g(-x) = f(x) \cdot g(x) = (fg)(x)
    $$

    This means $fg$ is an **even function**.

- When $f$ and $g$ are both odd functions, $f(-x) = -f(x), g(-x) = -g(x)$, such that

    $$
    (fg)(-x) = f(-x) \cdot g(-x) = (-f(x)) \cdot (-g(x)) = f(x) \cdot g(x) = (fg)(x)
    $$

    This means $fg$ is an **even function**.

- When $f$ is and even function and $g$ is an odd function, $f(-x) = f(x), g(-x) = -g(x)$, such that

    $$
    (fg)(-x) = f(-x) \cdot g(-x) = f(x) \cdot (-g(x)) = -(f(x) \cdot g(x)) = -(fg)(x) 
    $$

    This means $fg$ is an **odd function**.
