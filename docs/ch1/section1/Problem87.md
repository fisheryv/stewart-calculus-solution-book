If $f$ and $g$ are both even functions, is $f+g$ even? If $f$ and $g$ are both odd functions, is $f+g$ odd? What if $f$ is even and $g$ is odd? Justify your answers.

<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

- When $f$ and $g$ are both even functions, $f(-x) = f(x), g(-x) = g(x)$, such that

    $$
    (f+g)(-x) = f(-x)+g(-x) = f(x)+g(x) = (f+g)(x)
    $$

    This means $f+g$ is an **even function**.

- When $f$ and $g$ are both odd functions, $f(-x) = -f(x), g(-x) = -g(x)$, such that

    $$
    (f+g)(-x) = f(-x)+g(-x) = -f(x)-g(x) = -(f(x)+g(x)) = -(f+g)(x)
    $$

    This means $f+g$ is an **odd function**.

- When $f$ is and even function and $g$ is an odd function, $f(-x) = f(x), g(-x) = -g(x)$, such that

    $$
    (f+g)(-x) = f(-x)+g(-x) = f(x)-g(x)
    $$

    This means $f+g$ is **nether an odd function nor an even function**.
