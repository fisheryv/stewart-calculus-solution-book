<h4 class="alert-heading">Solution</h4>

1. $f(-4) = -2, \; g(3) = 4$.

2. Draw a perpendicular line to the x-axis at $x = -3$, intersecting the graphs of the two functions at two points. Observing the two points, it is found that the point on the graph of $g(x)$ is higher than the point on the graph of $f(x)$. Therefore, $g(-3) > f(-3)$.

3. $f(x) = g(x)$ means for the same $x$, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ share the same value, represented as the intersection of the two function graphs. Therefore, when $x = 2$ and $x=-2$, $f(x) = g(x)$.

4. The inequality $f(x) \le g(x)$ appears graphically as the graph of $f(x)$ lying below the graph of $g(x)$ (including the points of intersection). Therefore the interval is $[-4, -2] \cup [2, 3]$.

!> Be careful! The domains of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are different. When comparing the magnitudes of two functions, they can only be compared where both are well-defined, so we must take the intersection of their domains.

5. When $x=-3$ or $x=4$, $f(x) = -1$. So the solution is $\{-3, 4\}$.

6. The decreasing interval means for any $a > b$ in the interval, $g(a) < g(b)$. So, the decreasing interval of function $g$ is $[-4, 0]$.

7. The domain of $f$ is $[-4, 4]$, the codomain of $g$ is $[-2, 3]$.

8. The domain of $g$ is $[-4, 3]$, the codomain of $g$ is $[0.5, 4]$.
