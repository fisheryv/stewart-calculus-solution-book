The deck of a bridge is suspended 80 meters above a river. If a pebble falls off the side of the bridge, the height, in meters, of the pebble above the water surface after t seconds is given 
by $y = 80 - 4.9t^2$.

1. Find the average velocity of the pebble for the time period beginning when $t = 4$ and lasting

    <div align="center">

    (a) $0.1$ seconds $\qquad$ (b) $0.05$ seconds $\qquad$ (c) $0.01$ seconds
    
    </div>

2. Estimate the instantaneous velocity of the pebble after $4$Â seconds.
