A tank holds $1000$ liters of water, which drains from the bottom of the tank in half an hour. The values in the table show the volume $V$ of water remaining in the tank (in liters) after $t$ minutes.

<div style="text-align:center">
<table style="display:inline">
    <tr>
        <td style="background-color: #b5f4fc; font-weight: 600;"> t (min) </td>
        <td>5</td><td>10</td><td>15</td><td>20</td><td>25</td><td>30</td>
    <tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="background-color: #b5f4fc; font-weight: 600;"> V (L) </td>
        <td>694</td><td>444</td><td>250</td><td>111</td><td>28</td><td>0</td>
    <tr>
</table>
</div>

1. If $P$ is the point $(15, 250)$ on the graph of $V$, find the slopes of the secant lines $PQ$ when $Q$ is the point on the graph with $t = 5, 10, 20, 25$, and $30$.

2. Estimate the slope of the tangent line at $P$ by averaging the slopes of two secant lines.

3. Use a graph of $V$ to estimate the slope of the tangent line at $P$. (This slope represents the rate at which the water is flowing from the tank after 15 minutes.)
