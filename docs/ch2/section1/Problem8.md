The displacement (in centimeters) of a particle moving back and forth along a straight line is given by the equation of motion $s = 2 \sin \pi t + 3 \cos \pi t$, where $t$ is measured in 
seconds.

1. Find the average velocity during each time period:

    <div align="center">

    (a) $[1, 2] \qquad$ (b) $[1, 1.1] \qquad$ (c) $[1, 1.01] \qquad$ (d) $[1, 1.001]$

    </div>

2. Estimate the instantaneous velocity of the particle when $t = 1$.
