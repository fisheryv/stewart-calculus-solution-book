The point $P(1, 0)$ lies on the curve $y = \sin (10 \pi / x)$.

1. If $Q$ is the point $(x, \sin (10 \pi /x))$, find the slope of the secant line $PQ$ (correct to four decimal places) for $x = 2,\ 1.5,\ 1.4,\ 1.3,\ 1.2,\ 1.1,\ 0.5,\ 0.6,\ 0.7,\ 0.8$ and $0.9$. Do the slopes appear to be approaching a limit?

2. Use a graph of the curve to explain why the slopes of the secant lines in part (1) are not close to the slope of the tangent line at $P$.

3. By choosing appropriate secant lines, estimate the slope of the tangent line at $P$.
