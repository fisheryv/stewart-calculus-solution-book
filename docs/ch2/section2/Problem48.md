1. Evaluate the function

    $$ h(x) = \frac{\tan x - x}{x^3}$$

    for $x = 1,\ 0.5,\ 0.1,\ 0.05,\ 0.01$ and $0.005$.

2. Guess the value of $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\tan x - x}{x^3}$.

3. Evaluate $h(x)$ for successively smaller values of $x$ until you finally reach a value of $0$ for $h(x)$. Are you still confident that your guess in part (2) is correct? Explain why you eventually obtained $0$ values. (In Section 4.4 a method for evaluating this limit will be explained.)

4. ðŸ“ˆ Graph the function $h$ in the viewing rectangle $[-1, 1]$ by $[0, 1]$. Then zoom in toward the point where the graph crosses the $y$-axis to estimate the limit of $h(x)$ as $x$ approaches $0$. Continue to zoom in until you observe distortions in the graph of $h$. Compare with the results 
of partÂ (3).
